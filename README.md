# Mint

A barebones Node.js app using [Express 4](http://expressjs.com/).

## Running Locally

Pull down repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/treyhboy/Mint.git # or clone your own fork
cd Mint
```

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) installed.

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

You can also use Docker to run the app. This will remove the requirement of MySQL installed on your local machine and will run MySQL in a Docker container.
```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:3100](http://localhost:3100/).
